Hello! I am a software engineer and developer who can code full-stack websites in React or Spring with various stacks.

I also know how to code desktop app with C/C++, C#, Python but most of these skills were self-taught.

My GitHub is mostly filled with passion projects completely unrelated to my work. These are usually either game dev projects or a small desktop apps.
